# Weather-Data-Analysis.

	The file Weather History is a CSV file that contains Weather data. The dataset is taken from Kaggle open Source.
	Data was collected for a period of 11 years i.e., 2006 to 2016. The data is collected for each and every hour. 
	
	The dataset contains 96453 Rows and 12 Columns. The dataset contains 12 columns i.e., 'Formatted Date',
	'Summary', 'Precip Type', 'Temperature (C)', 'Apparent Temperature (C)', 'Humidity', 'Wind Speed (km/h)',
	'Wind Bearing (degrees)', 'Visibility (km)', 'Loud Cover', 'Pressure (millibars)', 'Daily Summary'.

## Requirements:
### Software.
      Jupyter notebook.
### Packages.
      Pandas 
      NumPy
      Matplotlib
      Seaborn

In this Analysis, I found the insights Like

1.	number of records on each Category in Precip Type Column.
2.	Unique values in each Column.
3.	First 30 Unique values in Wind Speed(km/h) Column.
4.	How many times the precip type Column has a value “rain”.
5.	How many times the wind speed is Less then 10km/h.
6.	Mean value of the visibility column.
7.	Standard Deviation of Pressure column.
8.	Variance of Humidity column.
9.	Finding all instances when the summary column has a value Dry.
10.	Finding all the instances with windspeed more than 24 AND Visibility Less than 10.
11.	Mean values of each column against Summary Column.
12.	Minimum & maximum value of each column against Summary.
13.	Finding the Correlation for all numerical variables.
